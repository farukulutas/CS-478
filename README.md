# CS-478
All my work in CS 478 - Computational Geometry course. 

## Project
### Implementation of Two Delaunay Triangulation Algorithms and Comparing Their Performance
#### (Randomized Incremental Algorithm & Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm)
We have also programmed a GUI application that allows users to interact with these 2 algorithms. The user can choose to run the algorithm with any number of points, add/remove points at will, and visualize the triangulation process with a simulation.

### Program Features
You can create any number of random points using the algorithm you want in the application. You can add or subtract points at certain coordinates. As a result of any change made in the graph, you can examine its performance from the bottom line. You can rotate the shape as many degrees as you want. You can examine the algorithm step by step by clicking the "Simulate Shape" button. By using the buttons in the lower-left corner, you can make changes to the graphic such as zoom in, zoom out, play, save, rewind.
